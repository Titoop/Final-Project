## _Created and editted by Tito Opawole_

#### This tutorial is going to show you how to draw a star using SVG code. Below are the steps ypu should follow.....

### Step 1
#### Start off by typing in your "svg" and "/svg" tag. This svg tag is basically where your code for your circle will be, with "svg" being the start, and "/svg" being the end.

### Step 2
#### So inside the "svg", go ahead and enter a width and height of your choice. When you are done, your code should look like this: 
**_svg wigth = "250" height = "250"_** 

### Step 3
#### Now inside your "SVG" tag, you open a circle tag, and this should be just like how we opened our SVG tag. you should have something like this:
**_circle />_**

### Step 4
#### Now inside your "Circle" tag, you type in "r = 125", and R in this case stands for radius. you should trat this step exactly like step 2. After your'e done, you should have:
**_circle r = "125"/>_**

### Step 5
#### At this point, your'e probably confused because now your circle is at the corner of your page but no need to worry this step will shouw you how to fix that. To fix this you just type in cx = "125", and cy = "125" cy and cy shows where the center would be in the x and y axis, and I chose 125 because it is half of our height and width. SO foar you should have this:
**_circle r = "125" cx = "125" cy "125"/>_**

<body>
<svg width = "250" height = "250">
    <circle r = "125" cx = "125" cy = "125"/>
</svg>
</body>

### Now you have a fully drawn SVG circle, please do share this with your friends and have a great day.
